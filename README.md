## Using the database

The BDNYC Database is a binary SQL file with a .db extension which can be accessed in many ways. 

However, we recommend you get the most out of your astronomy SQL databases with [astrodbkit](https://github.com/BDNYC/astrodbkit.git).

## Contributing your datasets

To contribute to this public repository, just fork this repo, add your data using [astrodbkit](https://github.com/BDNYC/astrodbkit.git), and issue a pull request!

If you are adding spectra, we require the files to be hosted by a public online academic library or similarly long-lived data or research repository. All data in the current version are hosted by the [CUNY Academic Works](http://academicworks.cuny.edu).
